This is composed of the following items.

* A required question.
* An optional audio mp3 file which asks the questions and also the spoken answers.
* Mandatory - check this if question is always asked. This is in addition to any random questions.
* Finally define which quiz this question relates to. Normally this will be set for you from the quiz you clicked managed questions against.
