Before talking about how you can construct your own content, it is worth while taking a moment to give you an overview of induction process and how this relates to this content.

* Each piece of content that you create is broken down into individual sections which we call modules.
* Each module describes a particular set of content (video, pdf, slides etc)
* Each module can have questions and answers associated with it or might not have any.
* An individual does not directly **'Take'** a module.
* Instead one or more modules are composed into an **'Induction'** and the user can take one or more inductions.

## Modules & Inductions

This combination of content modules and inductions allows for a great deal of flexibility within the system. You can, for instance, have some general content modules that are included in various inductions that every one takes. These can then be supplemented with additional modules for specific audiences.

It also allows you to break down large training sections - into smaller 'bite sized' pieces that can have questions and answers associated with them.

## Import Content

As alluded to above - induct and train offers a number of different methods to create your induction content. In general terms, we recommend creating your content in industrial leading tools such as MS Office, and importing these into induct & train. This has several advantages.

* You can use the tools you are already familiar with.
* You retain outright ownership on your material - it is not buried away in some 3rd party system.
* You can use the material outside of our system (such as if internet connection issues or large group inductions).

We try to make this process as seamless as possible by providing import facilities to automate this for you.
