Also the configuration can be linked to the user role. Such that different information can be captured for visitors vs employees or contractors.

The details entered into this screen are confirmed by the end user before being allowed to complete an induction and this consent is retained and audited. 

Below are screen shots and a brief description of each configurable section.
