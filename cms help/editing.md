title: 2. Editing and publishing content workflow
---
The CMS follows a series of steps in the editing through to publishing process.

All currently published content will be shown in the **'Content'** section from the main navigation menu, however other content can only be seen in the editorial **'Workflow'** section from the main nav. Editing existing content will mark it as unpublished and you will need to republish in order to go live. Remember all edits are version controlled in Git and can be recovered if you make a mistake.

You can add new content from the **'Workflow'** you can move content through a series of statuses, Draft, Review and Ready. You can choose to publish at anytime from either status. Clicking onto a item in the workflow will enable you to edit that item and also generate a **preview.** Before publishing the content you should first generate a preview and see what the live content will look like.
